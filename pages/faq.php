<label>1. Where do you source your yarn from?</label><br /><br />
<p>When sourcing yarn, we do our best to buy raw material that is good for all those involved in the making of it. However, we also have limitations due to our small operation. Therefore, we work with different yarns at different times depending on what we can get our hands on.</p>
<p>Currently, we are working with a 100% silk yarn from Art Fibers (originally located in San Francisco).They proudly produced the silk in the Bay Area, which is one of the things that made us so happy to find them. Our Alpaca/Silk is spun in Peru, long known for its Alpacas. And our wools currently come from small businesses that hae salvaged woolens from the former woolen mills of the Northeastern United States.</p>
<label>2. What makes your product special?</label><br /><br />
<p>We believe our product to be superior to the average "fast fashion." Great knowledge and precision goes into the process from start to finish. Both of us studied textiles in college, and it was here that we each garnered in-depth information on fiber, construction, and textile production.</p>
<p>We each spend hours creating these garments of clothing and coloring them with our hands and imaginations. Since everything is a small batch, each one possess unique variations that make it truly one-of-a-kind. </p>
<label>3. Do you take custom orders?</label><br /><br />
<p>We do. If you would like to request more information please email us at studio@mythofthewest.com . Please allow 24 hours for a response.</p>
<label>4. How often do you have new items?</label><br /><br />
<p>We operate in a seasonal fashion. Therefore, we seek to introduce two completely new seasons each year. Once in Spring and once in Fall. In between these two main seasons we may offer buffer items that help our line transition between the seasons. </p>

<label>5. Do you accept wholesale account?</label><br /><br />
<p>We do. If you would like to make a wholesale inquiry, please contact us by email to studio@mythofthewest.com</p>
<label>6. Do you sell anywhere else? </label><br /><br />
<p>Yes. Along with our personal website we have an Etsy shop that can be viewed at www.mythofthewest.etsy.com . </p>
<label>7. Do you accept returns/exchanges?</label><br /><br />
<p>Due to our slow fashion, handcrafted nature, generally we do not. However, if something arrives to you damaged, we can discuss an appropriate solution. If the item is damaged from your own use, there can be no returns. </p>
<p>If you would like to make an exchange you need to do so within 14 days of receiving the item. Item must come back with all tags attached, in condition it was sent and with the receipt. </p>
<p>All custom orders are Final Sale. </p>
<label>8. Are your garments washed before they are shipped?</label><br /><br />
<p>Each garment or small accessory is dry cleaned using an Eco-friendly method of dry cleaning. Each item will arrive to you fresh, complete with care label sew in so you can continue to care for the item.</p>
