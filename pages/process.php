<p>MYTH OF THE WEST believes in a return to the handmade process and overall superior American- made craftsmanship. We design, knit, color and steam in our individual studios in West Oakland CA.</p><br />
<p>Because items are handmade, each will vary slightly from the one that came before it. Each item is truly unique and one of a kind.</p><br />
<p>We source our fibers as sensitively and locally as possible. Since we can not yet afford to meet mill "minimums," we rely heavily on close-out and odd lot inventories.</p><br />
<p>We are currently manufacturing using different types of yarn. They consist of silk, wool, or alpaca/silk fiber blends. Fibers will vary for MYTH OF THE WEST season to season depending on what is available, much like a seasonal farmer's market.</p><br />
<p>This season, the silk we were lucky enough to find came from ArtFibers originally located in SF. It is a Tussah silk yarn that has since been discontinued. It was produced in the San Francisco Bay Area as an ArtFibers exclusive brand yarn.</p><br />
<p>The wool we are using comes from Peter Patchi's Yarns in Rhode Island. It is re-claimed yarn that has been salvaged from the "trash" of defunct woolen mills in the New England region.</p><br />
<p>The alpaca/silk blend yarn is spun in Peru, and retailed by Valley Yarns in the United States.</p><br />
<p>Leah is the Knitwear Designer for MYTH OF THE WEST. She knits each garment and accessory by hand on her personal knitting machine. The knitting machine is manual and is hand-programmed by Leah who creates each item from her hands.</p><br />

<p>The item then joins Ailee for the hand-dyeing process. Ailee currently uses Acid dyes (which are non-toxic) due to their ability to reproduce colors very closely. While, we enjoy the variations piece to piece we love to follow a seasonal color story we can maintain for the entire collection. Ailee hopes to also involve natural dyes later in the future on limited edition special pieces.</p><br />
<p>Items are blocked to size, and dry-cleaned after the dyeing process to ensure no dye runoff for the customer. Each item has also been color set, so it will not fade in the wash. After the product is customer ready, each package is gift-wrapped by hand and sent away in the mail to our fantastic customers!</p><br />
<p>MYTH OF THE WEST is currently feeling inspired by nature and various geological formations in the landscapes around us. Check back with us for Fall/Winter to see where our minds have traveled! </p><br />
